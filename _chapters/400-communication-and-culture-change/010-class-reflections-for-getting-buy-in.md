## Intent

Equitable grading practices require getting buy-in from stakeholders such as administrators and students: class reflections can be one way to get buy-in from students.

## Problem

Equitable grading practices are often unfamiliar to students and administrators, which may interfere with deeply-held beliefs and values around traditional approaches to grading. Changing mindsets about grading is crucial toward successful implementation of equitable grading practices.

## Solution

Utilize student-centered discussions that enable students to come to their own conclusions about their prior experiences with grades and learning. Emphasize student proficiency and learning over grades as the goal of the course. Be transparent about potential discomfort that students may initially face.

## Applicability

This play is broadly applicable. Regardless of the educational context, students can benefit from knowing not only how grades will be determined at the end of the term, but also why the instructor chose their approach to grading. This is particularly important in educational contexts where students are more familiar with certain types of traditional grading (that do not emphasize, for instance, opportunities to demonstrate learning over time), which are common especially in higher education today.

## How to Implement

One way to get buy-in from students is by organizing class reflection activities. For example, during class, an instructor can lead a word association activity whereby students relate the words "grade" and "learning" to issues that the instructor identified as key motivations for adopting equitable grading practices. Through this reflection, students may start to realize that grades do not often have a positive influence on learning. The instructor can also reaffirm to students that their equitable grading practice will be uncomfortable at first but note that, by the end of the quarter, students often become comfortable with grading practices and gain a deeper appreciation for learning in the course.

I chose not to ask for permission to implement an equitable grading scheme as a new junior faculty as it was my research area, and my colleagues may disagree with me on whether I gave too many A’s in the two required courses I have taught thus far, but I was the first faculty in the deparment to implement several of Feldman's "Grading for Equity" interventions. I did constantly socialize my message that as a student, I had experienced inequitable grading, and as a CS educator, I chose to use an equitable grading scheme so that they could have a more positive educational experience. I repeatedly asked them to focus on mastery and learning, and that with some effort, their grades would reflect this. I socialized my messages in the course syllabus, including the statement “every student can earn an A” and that the bar for an A was not unreasonable. I built trust and minimized regrading by designing large automated question banks to allow for multiple resubmissions with flexible deadlines on quizzes and some assignments, even allowed a retake for a mid-term exam where students were very anxious about failing the course. Student reflections in group discussions are important for many reasons, not only to assess their own mastery and see their growth, but to build their competence and confidence in the subject matter, to build a sense of belonging by learning to listen and advocate their own views, and to know that not only did they do correct work, but they also did great work. I shared the learning outcomes we were covering at the start of each lecture slide deck, and ensured my decks were designed with accessibility in mind, including lots of examples; video recordings and transcripts were available online for students who might have missed a lecture. I also implemented an end-of-course student survey as a MS Forms mid-term survey given before the drop date, so that I could get feedback on my teaching and course-correct before the end of the semester. This enabled students to vent early and enabled me to get more positive student evaluations at a higher rate of participation at the end of the course. My total DFW rate for both courses was 2/81 students, and true to my word, most of the students earned A's and B's in both courses.
