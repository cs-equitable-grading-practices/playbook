title: Formative Assessments are for Learning

## Intent

Formative assessments are for learning and students should not be punished for getting things wrong while learning.

## Problem

Students take courses with varying degrees of prior experience.  Those who have learned a subject previously are better equipped to succeed on weekly assignments in a course.  Those who are brand new to a subject are still learning how to put the pieces together and are more likely to make mistakes as they learn material.  Formative assessments should be an opportunity for students to interact with new material and explore how everything fits together.  Making mistakes or failing to comprehend the complexity of a subject are common situations and students should not be penalized for these situations as the advance towards proficiency.  Unfortunately, traditional grading models frequently grade weekly work based on overall correctness which can be penalizing for students who are making legitimate progress but have not yet progressed to significant proficiency.


## Solution

Examples of formative assessments could include weekly labs, weekly quizzes, practice programs, and even certain exams. 

Formative assessments can be repeated until students get them “right.”  This may  involve setting initial, recommended deadlines but allowing students to continue to work on assessments until the end of the semester.  Assignments can be submitted for an initial assessment and may have conditions in place before a redo/retake attempt is allowed.  However, all are understood to be for learning purposes and thus should be open for opportunities to further student learning by revisiting mistakes or improving progress.

## Applicability

Every play involves tradeoffs, and this is the spot to describe them and explain when this play is a good idea or works, and when it might not be applicable or might be harder to use. Answer the question of: “In what contexts should we use this play?”
