title: Weighting of Formative vs. Summative activities

## Intent

If grade activities are to be weighted to maintain grades in the 0-100% continuum, formative and summative assessments need to be weighted properly to reflect growth from different starting points.

## Problem

A traditional grading system based on a 100-point scale provides 60 ways to fail and 41 ways to pass (based on the assumption that a student needs 60% or better to pass a course).  Unfortunately, when students come from different backgrounds, abilities, and resources, this system tends to hurt those who start further back.  Additionally, it heavily penalizes students for failures while learning making it difficult to earn “good” grades.  This discourages students to continue to improve and master topics over time if they do not master things the first time through.

## Solution

When a clear differentiation is made between formative assessments – activities designed to promote learning – and summative assessments – activities designed to assess a student’s skills and knowledge at a particular point in time – then a proper weighting scheme between the two types of assessment is beneficial.  

If formative assessments are considered learning activities, and thus are repeatable and have flexible deadlines, then students have ample opportunities to earn 100% of the points on these activities.  Weighting formative assessments as 60% of the final grade allows all students the opportunity to earn a “passing” grade through hard work and perseverance.  
Similarly, if summative assignments are the opportunity for students to demonstrate competency and measure skill level in the subject, by making this 40% of the final grade the summative assignments set a student’s level of mastery within the passing grade category.

## Applicability

Many adopters of EGP switch their grading away from the 100-point scale when assigning final letter grades.  
This technique is particularly applicable in environments where instructors wish to employ additional EGP practices, but are expected to report grades using a 100 point scale for institutional consistency.  By modifying how activity grades are weighted/combined a more equitable environment can be created.

## Intent

Formative assessments are for learning and students should not be punished for getting things wrong while learning.

## Problem

Students take courses with varying degrees of prior experience.  Those who have learned a subject previously are better equipped to succeed on weekly assignments in a course.  Those who are brand new to a subject are still learning how to put the pieces together and are more likely to make mistakes as they learn material.  Formative assessments should be an opportunity for students to interact with new material and explore how everything fits together.  Making mistakes or failing to comprehend the complexity of a subject are common situations and students should not be penalized for these situations as the advance towards proficiency.  Unfortunately, traditional grading models frequently grade weekly work based on overall correctness which can be penalizing for students who are making legitimate progress but have not yet progressed to significant proficiency.


## Solution

Examples of formative assessments could include weekly labs, weekly quizzes, practice programs, and even certain exams. 
Formative assessments can be repeated until students get them “right.”  This may  involve setting initial, recommended deadlines but allowing students to continue to work on assessments until the end of the semester.  Assignments can be submitted for an initial assessment and may have conditions in place before a redo/retake attempt is allowed.  However, all are understood to be for learning purposes and thus should be open for opportunities to further student learning by revisiting mistakes or improving progress.
## Applicability

Every play involves tradeoffs, and this is the spot to describe them and explain when this play is a good idea or works, and when it might not be applicable or might be harder to use. Answer the question of: “In what contexts should we use this play?”

## How to Implement

Time management, by the instructor / course staff and the students, plays a major role in the success, or failure, of this particular play. Here are some factors that implementers should consider in that regard:

+ **Student procrastination**. Student assessment attempts are not uniformly distributed across the semester; students tend to put off assessments until the end of the course, and / or generally not space out assessment attempts. In the source article, the author spent an _average_ of 10 hours of week outside of class on assessments, with light weeks at the start of the term and many hours spent in the last week of the term. Instructors may want to consider ways to either incentivize students to spread out their attempts throughout the term, or to place a tight upper bound on the time spent per week on assessments. For instance, the source author limited student assessment attempts to one per day, as one way to manage instructor time and energy.
+ **Instructor time allocation**. While this play requires a significant amount of time for meeting with students, for assessments and for regular office hours, some of that time does come from the time that would otherwise be devoted to grading, and managing grading. Implementers may also want to think about how and when to allow assessments: during general office hours, during specific assessment hours, during lab or class time, etc.
