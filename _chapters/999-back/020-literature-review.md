title: Working Group Literature Review
slug: wg-literature-review
---

The initial contents of this Playbook were identified using a systematic
literature review. The review process is documented in our working group
report (under review for publication). The question this literature review
aimed to answer was:

> What grading practices have been used in STEM courses to:
> - Focus attention on learning outcomes instead of grading, or
> - Improve equity, or
> - Improve the student learning experience.

We used the following search query on Google Scholar to identify documents
that might describe "plays" (grading practices) that could answer this
question:

> (~grading|"mastery grading"|"alternative grading"| "specification grading"|"specifications grading"|"mastery learning"|"specs grading"|”grading for equity”|"ungrading”| “un-grading”| "contract grading") (practice|strategy| technique|tactic|method)
(~equity|~improving)

We focused on the top 200 results found by Google Scholar, which were downloaded
using [Publish or Perish](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish):

    [CSV of search query 200 results](/playbook/query-results-200.csv)

We then manually reviewed the 200 results, applying the specific inclusion and
exclusion criteria documented in our report, narrowing the scope to 40
papers meeting our stated criteria:

    [CSV of final 40 results](/playbook/final-40-publications.csv)

See our working group report for details on these papers, including a table
showing which plays came from each paper and full bibliographic citations
for all papers.
